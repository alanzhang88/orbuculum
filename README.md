# orbuculum
An orbuculum that maps google streetview to a interactive reflective ball (so not technically an orbuculum). The visualization enables user to control where they want to see (only within the range of Google Streetview's ability) via either voice recognition or straightforward direction control. The orbuculum is placed in a mystical environment with smokes and shadow.

Advance Topics:
1. Direct visualization of google street view via environment mapping
2. Advanced shading...
3. Shadow...

Heads up:
1. Every time before using w,a,s,d to move around the map, you need to click the map first
2. When using voice input, try to give only the name of a place.
